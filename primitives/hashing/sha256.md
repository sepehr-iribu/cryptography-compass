## What is SHA-256?
SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that is part of the SHA-2 family, designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States. It generates a fixed 256-bit (32-byte) output, commonly represented as a hexadecimal string of 64 characters.

### Key Features
#### Deterministic :
 The same input will always produce the same output, ensuring consistency in hashing.
#### Fixed Output Size :
Regardless of the input size, SHA-256 always produces a 256-bit hash.
Pre-image Resistance: It is computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original input from the hash output, providing a level of security against attacks.
#### Collision Resistance :
 It is extremely unlikely for two different inputs to produce the same hash output, ensuring data integrity.
#### Avalanche Effect :
 A small change in the input will produce a significantly different hash, enhancing security and making it harder to predict outputs.
### Use Cases
#### Cryptocurrencies :
 SHA-256 is widely used in Bitcoin for mining and transaction verification.
#### Data Integrity :
 It helps verify the integrity of files by allowing users to compare hash values.
#### Digital Signatures :
 It is often used in creating digital signatures, ensuring that data has not been altered.
### How Does SHA-256 Work?
Here is an overview of the steps involved in SHA-256:

#### Input Preparation:
 The input message is padded to ensure its length is a multiple of 512 bits, which involves adding a '1' bit, followed by '0' bits, and appending the original length of the message.
#### Initialization:
 Eight initial hash values, each 32 bits long, are set based on the first 32 bits of the square roots of the first 64 prime numbers.
#### Processing Blocks:
 The padded message is divided into 512-bit blocks. Each block is expanded into a schedule of 64 words, and a series of logical operations, including modular addition and bitwise functions, are applied to update the hash values.
#### Finalization:
 After processing all blocks, the final hash values are concatenated to produce a 256-bit hash output.
#### Output:
 The result is expressed as a 64-character hexadecimal string, representing the SHA-256 hash of the original input.
